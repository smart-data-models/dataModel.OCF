    This Resource specifies conditions that can be applied to an observed value in any Resource.These conditions are applied by the OCF Server exposing the Resource to any generated notifications because of subscriptions to the Resource.A unicast RETRIEVE to the Resource will receive the most recent value; which may not be the most recent notified value.An OCF Server exposes this Resource in association with the Resource conveying the observed value.This is done by means of a new Resource instance with an RT of ['oic.r.<thing being observed>', 'oic.r.value.conditional'], e.g ['oic.r.temperature', 'oic.r.value.conditional'].The Property 'threshold' is the amount by which the thing being observed must change before a notification is sent.The Property 'minnotifyperiod' is the minimum time in ms (milliseconds) that must elapse before a notification is sent.If the maxnotifyperiod (time in ms (milliseconds)) elapses then a notification must be sent.The Property 'maxnotifyperiod' is a timer that resets each time a notification is sent.A value of '0' for any of 'threshold',' minnotifyperiod' or 'maxnotifyperiod' means that the capability is supported but not active.
