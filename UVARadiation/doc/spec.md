Global description: **Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource specifies UV radiation measurement. The Property 'measurement' is the current measured UVA. The intensity of UV radiation is measured in the units of milliwatts per square centimeter (mW/cm2) which is energy per square centimeter received per second. UVA is measured between 315 and 400 nanometers in the electromagnetic spectrum.**  

## List of properties  

- `address`: The mailing address  - `alternateName`: An alternative name for this item  - `areaServed`: The geographic area where a service or offered item is provided  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `description`: A description of this item  - `id`: Unique identifier of the entity  - `if`: The OCF Interface set supported by this Resource.  - `location`: Geojson reference to the item. It can be Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString or MultiPolygon  - `measurement`: The measured UVA.  - `n`: Friendly name of the Resource  - `name`: The name of this item.  - `owner`: A List containing a JSON encoded sequence of characters referencing the unique Ids of the owner(s)  - `rt`: The Resource Type.  - `seeAlso`: list of uri pointing to additional resources about the item  - `source`: A sequence of characters giving the original source of the entity data as a URL. Recommended to be the fully qualified domain name of the source provider, or the URL to the source object.  - `type`: NGSI entity type. It has to be UVARadiation    
Required properties  
- `id`  - `type`    
This data model comes from the original [Open Connectivity Foundation repository](https://github.com/openconnectivityfoundation/IoTDataModels). It has been extended to comply with NGSI requirements.

#### UVARadiation NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a UVARadiation in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.
