    Smart Data Models Program adaptation of the original IoTData data Models. This Resource provides a set of device defined levels that can be selected for an operation. For example where a humidifier has a discrete set that model different humidity levels that can be set. The Property 'availablelevels' is an array of the levels that can be selected, these can be a number or an integer (as subset of integer). The Property 'targetlevel' is the level that has currently been selected and is written to in order to select a new level. When retrieved the targetlevel provides the actual value that has been selected.
